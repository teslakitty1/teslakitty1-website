    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi there! I'm a 15-year-old who's really interested in a lot of cool things.</p>
    <p>I'm autistic</p>
    <p>I'm also part of the furry community (started being one still learning), which is something I enjoy a lot!</p>
    <p>Cats are definitely one of my favorite animals â€“ I just love them!</p>
    <p>And last but not least, I have a big passion for computers. I find them fascinating!</p>
